OpenRouter strives to provide access to every potentially useful text-based AI model. We currently support over 300 models endpoints.

If there are models or providers you are interested in that OpenRouter doesn’t have, please tell us about them in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW).

##### Different models tokenize text in different ways

Some models break up text into chunks of multiple characters (GPT, Claude,
Llama, etc), while others tokenize by character (PaLM). This means that token
counts (and therefore costs) will vary between models, even when inputs and
outputs are the same. Costs are displayed and billed according to the
tokenizer for the model in use.

Explore and browse 300+ models and providers [on our website](https://openrouter.ai/models), or [with our API](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/list-available-models).

## For Providers
